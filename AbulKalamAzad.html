    <h3>Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin Ahmed bin Khairuddin Al-Hussaini Azad ((About this soundlisten (help·info)) 11
        November 1888 – 22 February 1958) was an Indian independence activist, Islamic theologian, writer and a senior
        leader of the Indian National Congress. Following India's independence, he became the First Minister of
        Education in the Indian government. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific
        meaning 'Our Master' and he had adopted Azad (Free) as his pen name. His contribution to establishing the
        education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India.
